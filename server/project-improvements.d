# Project Improvement Recommendations

## Architecture & Structure

### Code Organization
- **Consistent Module Patterns**: Some service modules use class-based approach while others use function exports. Standardize on one pattern.
- **Folder Structure**: Consider organizing by feature rather than technical role for better modularity (e.g., `/events/` containing controllers, services, models for events).
- **Circular Dependencies**: Check for and eliminate any circular dependencies between modules.

### API Design
- **REST Consistency**: 
  - Standardize response formats across all endpoints (good work on centralizing pagination in `formatPaginatedResponse`).
  - Ensure consistent URL patterns (noticed `/events` is used twice in routes).
  - Implement HATEOAS links for better API navigation.
- **Versioning**: Consider adding API versioning (e.g., `/v1/events`) to support future changes.
- **Rate Limiting**: Current implementation exists but consider more granular limits per endpoint or user role.

## Code Quality

### Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Very limited test files found. Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and e2e tests.
- **Test Organization**: Create a consistent structure for test files that mirrors the application structure.
- **Mocking Strategy**: Develop consistent approach to mocking external dependencies in tests.

### Error Handling
- **Error Consistency**: Good error class hierarchy, but ensure all services use these consistently.
- **Validation Errors**: Consider more detailed validation error messages with field-specific guidance.
- **Global Error Boundary**: Current implementation is good but could be enhanced with more context.

### Performance
- **Database Queries**: Review for N+1 query issues, especially in paginated endpoints.
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching for frequently accessed, rarely changing data.
- **Connection Pooling**: Ensure database connections are properly pooled and managed.

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Token Management**: Implement refresh tokens alongside access tokens.
- **Password Policies**: Enforce stronger password requirements.
- **Role-Based Access**: Enhance current authorization with more granular permissions.
- **Security Headers**: Review and enhance security headers beyond basic Helmet configuration.

### Data Protection
- **Input Sanitization**: Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized before processing.
- **PII Handling**: Review how personally identifiable information is stored and transmitted.
- **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logs for security-sensitive operations.

## DevOps & Maintenance

### Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Current Winston implementation is good, consider adding more context.
- **Log Rotation**: Ensure logs are properly rotated and archived.
- **Monitoring Integration**: Add hooks for monitoring tools to consume logs.

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Create a validation layer for environment variables.
- **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags for easier feature rollouts.
- **Secrets Management**: Review how secrets are managed and consider a vault solution.

### Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Swagger implementation is good, enhance with more examples.
- **Code Documentation**: Add more comprehensive JSDoc comments to all functions.
- **Developer Guides**: Create onboarding documentation for new developers.

## Specific Issues

### Routes
- Fix duplicate route registration: `/events` is used for both event routes and participant routes.

### Pagination
- Response format has been updated to use `data` instead of `list` which is good.
- Consider adding metadata like `links` for next/prev pages in pagination responses.

### Database
- Add database migrations for schema changes.
- Consider implementing soft deletes instead of hard deletes.
- Add database indexing strategy for frequently queried fields.

### Error Middleware
- Add correlation IDs that span across microservices if applicable.
- Enhance error categorization for better client-side handling.

## Technical Debt

### Dependencies
- Review and update outdated dependencies.
- Consider implementing dependency scanning for security vulnerabilities.
- Document third-party dependencies and their purposes.

### Code Smells
- Look for and refactor duplicated code, especially in validation logic.
- Review large functions and classes for potential breaking down.
- Implement linting rules to prevent future code smells.

## Future Enhancements

### Scalability
- Prepare for horizontal scaling with stateless design.
- Consider implementing message queues for asynchronous processing.
- Plan for database sharding or read replicas if growth is expected.

### Maintainability
- Implement code quality gates in CI/CD pipeline.
- Add performance benchmarks to prevent regressions.
- Create architectural decision records (ADRs) for major decisions.

### User Experience
- Add pagination links in response headers.
- Implement field selection to allow clients to request only needed fields.
- Consider implementing GraphQL alongside REST for complex data requirements.
